# Cisco-Packet-Tracer

## Objective

With the Cisco Packet Tracer, you learn how data travels across your network using Simulation Mode, or practice setting up your own device rack and cables in Physical Mode. Once you are ready, expand your simulations to analyze network traffic, add Internet of Things (IoT) devices, integrate Python code, or practice network automation skills.
